# GitHub Integration

Generally, LiveCodes can be used anonymously without any accounts. This includes [importing](./import.md) code from GitHub gists or public repos.

However, some features do require [login](./user-management.md) with a GitHub account and giving [specific permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) to make use of GitHub services (e.g. [import](./import.md) from private repos, [export](./export.md) to gist, [deploy](./deploy.md), [assets](./assets.md) and [sync](./sync.md)).
